# Quadruped-Robot-Arduino
This was a school project with the intention of developing a quadruped robot or robot dog. In this repository you can find the Arduino code that was used for the robot dog. The code is not as polished as it could be due to deadlines and its main purpose was only for testing, not production. But it is functional for the prototype that I made using 12 servo motors and an IMU sensor.
